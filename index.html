			<h2>Background Information</h2>
			<p>I was born in Australia, but my grandparents and a chunk of my family came from Italy here by boat. This is my first year at any University and to date I have only finished up to year 11 because year 12 just become too much for my mental health. Before I left however I used to enjoy a whole range of subjects like English, Legal studies and History. Interesting fact about myself I have had a scar on my right wrist since I was 3 years old. From a cut I got a playground from a beer bottle glass that was hidden underneath the bark.</p>
